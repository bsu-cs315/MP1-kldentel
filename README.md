# Mini-Project 1: Dodge the Creeps

## Project Report

### Reflection
Godot's "Your First Game" tutorial was a joy to work through. I appreciated the step-by-step documentation and sidenotes that were provided for challenges I could run into throughout future projects. The project seemed to compile and run quickly compared to other tools which is helpful when learning anything new. This was my first time creating a game using a dedicated game engine and it has created additional excitement for me as I continue working with it.
